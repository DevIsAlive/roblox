# Project Planning Document

## Project Overview
The Roblox Avatar Viewer is designed to be a minimalist, user-friendly application that provides instant access to Roblox avatars. The focus is on simplicity and performance.

## Architecture

### Frontend
- **HTML Structure**
  - Minimal DOM elements
  - Single input field for username
  - Dynamic avatar display area
  - Suggestions container

- **CSS Architecture**
  - Mobile-first responsive design
  - Clean, modern styling
  - Smooth animations for user interactions
  - Dark/light mode support (planned)

- **JavaScript Architecture**
  - Event-driven architecture
  - Asynchronous API calls
  - Debounced input handling
  - Error handling and user feedback

### Backend (Netlify Functions)
- Serverless functions for API handling
- Rate limiting implementation
- Caching strategy for frequently requested avatars

## Current Features
- [x] Username input with suggestions
- [x] Real-time avatar preview
- [x] Responsive design
- [x] Clean, minimalist UI

## Planned Features
- [ ] Dark/Light mode toggle
- [ ] Avatar customization options
- [ ] Share functionality
- [ ] Avatar history
- [ ] Performance optimizations

## Performance Goals
- Page load time < 2 seconds
- Avatar load time < 1 second
- Smooth animations (60fps)
- Mobile-friendly experience

## Code Style Guidelines
- Use semantic HTML elements
- Follow BEM naming convention for CSS
- Use async/await for asynchronous operations
- Implement proper error handling
- Add JSDoc comments for functions

## Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for core functionality
- Integration tests for API calls
- Cross-browser testing
- Mobile device testing

## Deployment Strategy
- Continuous deployment via Netlify
- Automated testing before deployment
- Version control with semantic versioning
- Regular security updates

## Future Considerations
1. **Scalability**
   - Implement caching
   - Optimize API calls
   - Consider CDN integration

2. **User Experience**
   - Add loading states
   - Improve error messages
   - Enhance mobile experience

3. **Technical Debt**
   - Regular code reviews
   - Performance monitoring
   - Security audits

## Maintenance Plan
